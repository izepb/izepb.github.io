## Work Experiences

**Feb  - Aug 2016**
	
Research intern at Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine (JRC-COMBINE) at RWTH-Aachen University, Germany (supervised by Prof. Julio Saez-Rodriguez and Dr. Marc Brehme)

*Description: I focus on machine learning methods for integrating multiple genomic features to enhance the predictive power of drug responses. The project particularly focuses on membrane transporter genomic profiles, aiming to gain more insights in cellular drug transport.*

**Summer 2015**

Research intern at Probabilistic Machine Learning Group at Aalto University, Finland (supervised by Prof. Samuel Kaski and Dr. Pekka Marttinen)

*Description: During my internship, I helped refining the Bayesian Group Factor Analysis (GFA) method in predicting drug response of cancer patients based on multiple genomic profiles.* 

**2012-2013**	

Undergraduate research trainee in Computational Regulatory Genomics Group at Imperial College London and MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, UK (supervised by Prof. Boris Lenhard and Dr. Nathan Harmston)

*Description: I analysed epigenomic data (ChIA-PET, ChIP-seq) to explore the promoter landscapes and long-range gene regulation.*

**2011-2013**

Undergraduate research trainee in Systems Biology of Gene Expression Regulation Group at Mahidol University (supervised by Dr. Varodom Charoensawan)
